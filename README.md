simple_chain_ik
========

Description
------------

A package to handle in a simple manner (configurable by parameters) various sub-chains from a single robot model.
An example of this is obtained in the launch and config files which come with this package, which rely on the [qb_legs_description](https://bitbucket.org/hamalMarino/qb_legs_description) package for defining a sample robot.


Dependencies
------------

This package depends on the [dual_manipulation_shared](https://bitbucket.org/dualmanipulation/shared) package, to allow an easy implementation of parameters parsing.
